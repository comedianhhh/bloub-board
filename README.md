# Youbid

Youbid is a paid public leaderboard at [youbid.lol](https://youbid.lol). A visitor picks a bid of at least $1, submits a product URL or X handle, pays through hosted Stripe Checkout, and ranks by **current** balance. Every live amount falls 3% a day and drops off below $1. Creating checkout never changes the board. Only a verified paid webhook does.

The product idea and board layout take cues from [outbid.lol](http://outbid.lol/). Youbid is a separate implementation.

## What you get

- A public board with live projected rank, current (decaying) amounts, and the date each listing drops off
- Hover/focus **claim this rank** pills priced at that row’s current amount plus $1, not the historical total
- Identity as a URL or `@handle`. Youbid tries to read a title, description, and favicon from the page. If that fails — or the input is an X handle — the visitor fills title and description before paying
- Hosted Stripe Checkout for the reserved bid. A raise charges the gap to the current decayed amount. Localhost can mock-settle through the same planner
- A three-hour first-page takeover. Price starts at 4× current #1 after the last takeover ends and falls to 1.2× over 24 hours. First place is the decayed leader
- `/rules` for the public contract: 3% daily decay, owner-only raises while live, the falling takeover, identity, and refunds
- `/stats` for live listings, volume, distinct visitors, and outbound clicks, computed from D1 at request time
- `/llms.txt`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, and JSON-LD so search engines and assistants can describe the board accurately
- `/go/$listingId` records a click and redirects to the sponsored URL
- `/receipts/$intentId` after return from checkout

## Stack

TanStack Start on Cloudflare Workers, D1 as the authority store, Stripe Checkout with **dynamic** `price_data.unit_amount`. There is no Stripe Product or Price catalog. Each bid is one ad-hoc line item in integer cents. Package manager is **pnpm**.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd youbid
pnpm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
pnpm exec wrangler d1 migrations apply youbid-lol --local
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Keep `APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"` in `.dev.vars` so mock checkout stays local. Fill secret **names** from the example file; never commit real keys.

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

`wrangler.jsonc` binds `DB` to D1 database `youbid-lol`. Schema is in `migrations/`. Apply a new file the same way (`--local` for Vite, `--remote` for production).

## Local vs production

The board is paid D1 rows only, locally and on [youbid.lol](https://youbid.lol). An empty board is correct until a live payment settles. Mock checkout and `POST /api/mock/settle` run only when `APP_URL` is localhost.

## Deploy

```bash
pnpm exec wrangler d1 migrations apply youbid-lol --remote
pnpm run deploy
```

Set production secrets with `pnpm exec wrangler secret put` (`OWNER_COOKIE_SECRET`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`). Do not commit `.dev.vars`.

## Automatic deploys

This is **Workers Builds**, not Pages. On the existing Worker `youbid-lol`: **Settings → Builds → Connect**. The dashboard Worker name must match `name` in `wrangler.jsonc` (`youbid-lol`).

Workers Builds does **not** honor a `[build]` block in Wrangler. Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` so the build image installs with pnpm. Fill **Settings → Build**:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Git branch | `main` |
| Root directory | leave empty (repo root) |
| Build command | `pnpm run build` |
| Deploy command | `pnpm exec wrangler deploy` |
| Non-production branch deploy command | `pnpm exec wrangler versions upload` (only if you enable non-production branch builds) |
| API token | leave the auto-created token |

There is **no install command**. The image installs from `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Do not set `pnpm run deploy` as the deploy command: that script already runs `vite build`, so you would build twice.

Do not put Stripe keys, webhook secrets, or `OWNER_COOKIE_SECRET` in **Build variables**. Those are runtime secrets: **Settings → Variables & Secrets**, or `pnpm exec wrangler secret put`. `APP_URL` is already a Wrangler `vars` value (`https://youbid.lol`). Build vars are not available at runtime.

D1 migrations are not part of `wrangler deploy`. After a schema change, run `pnpm exec wrangler d1 migrations apply youbid-lol --remote` yourself (idempotent), or prepend that command to the deploy command if you want it on every push.

## Stripe

Hosted Checkout builds one line item from the reserved bid cents:

```ts
price_data: { currency: 'usd', unit_amount: reservedBidCents, product_data: { name, description } }
```

Live webhook: `https://youbid.lol/api/webhooks/stripe`

Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`, `charge.refunded`.

Success URL is `/receipts/$intentId?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`. Cancel URL is `/?checkout=cancelled`. No publishable key; Checkout is hosted.
